\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{Interpretation of Results}

The extensive convergence tests conducted across various algorithms highlighted a nuanced behavior in their performance, particularly under variable computational and market conditions. Notably, AMLMC and WAMLMC exhibited the most consistent closeness to the desired accuracy, which can be attributed to their adaptive mechanisms. These algorithms dynamically update their estimates of variance and bias throughout their execution cycles, allowing them to fine-tune their convergence thresholds in real-time. This adaptivity is crucial, especially in volatile markets where estimation parameters can shift unpredictably. Conversely, MLMC and MLQMC, which rely more rigidly on initial estimates and a predetermined number of samples, displayed a dependency that varied significantly with the financial model used. Particularly concerning was the tendency of MLQMC to overshoot the required accuracy, often resulting in higher computational costs than necessary. This behavior suggests a potential inefficiency in its cost-performance balance, as it expends resources to achieve a precision that may not always provide proportional value in practical financial applications.

Moreover, the sensitivity tests focused on market parameters such as volatility and moneyness further underscored the critical impact of these factors on algorithm performance. All tested algorithms demonstrated a marked dependence on volatility levels, with optimal convergence observed at lower volatilities. At volatilities above 50\%, however, there was a stark degradation in performance, with error levels reaching impractical heights. This effect was exacerbated when options were deep in the money, indicating a dual sensitivity to both volatility and intrinsic value, which collectively challenge the reliability of these algorithms under extreme market conditions.

\subsection*{Comparison with Literature}

These empirical findings dovetail with established theoretical frameworks but also extend them in significant ways. Previous studies by Giles (2008) and Giles and Waterhouse (2014) have posited the efficiency of adaptive MLMC approaches in theoretical terms, particularly praising their ability to manage variance through dynamic adjustment mechanisms. Our study not only confirms these theoretical advantages but also contrasts them with the less flexible, more static MLMC and MLQMC methods, which do not adaptively adjust to changing conditions during runtime. While the theoretical literature suggests that MLMC types should exhibit a convergence efficiency of \(O(\epsilon^{-2})\) under certain conditions, our observations of MLQMC and AMLQMC indicate an even more favorable asymptotic behavior, approaching \(O(\epsilon^{-a})\) with 'a' closer to 1. This superior performance, particularly noted in AMLQMC, was not fully anticipated by existing models and represents a significant empirical deviation that merits further theoretical exploration.

\subsection*{Limitations}

While the results are promising, the limitations of this study are non-trivial and warrant careful consideration. The range of financial models and option types tested, though extensive, does not encompass the full spectrum of instruments and market conditions prevalent in the financial industry. This limitation may restrict the applicability of our findings to broader, more diverse financial contexts. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of algorithm performance to initial parameters—such as the number of samples per level and the degree of randomization used—suggests that without meticulous calibration, the effectiveness of these algorithms could be compromised. The challenges posed by high volatility scenarios are particularly concerning, as they significantly impair the accuracy of estimations, potentially leading to unreliable outputs. Given these constraints, there is a clear need for additional research aimed at refining these algorithms to enhance their robustness and reliability, especially under adverse market conditions.
