MLMC project for Monte Carlo Projuct course validation

\section*{Gap Analysis}
The existing literature on Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods presents several important but limited comparisons, particularly with respect to the Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method. Most studies compare MLMC against randomized QMC, a slower variant that, while legitimate due to its ability to provide confidence interval estimation, does not reflect the faster, non-randomized QMC methods commonly used in practice. This gap is significant because, although such comparisons are methodologically sound, they do not address the practical needs of industry where non-randomized QMC is preferred for its efficiency. Our research aims to fill this gap by directly comparing MLMC and its variants against the faster QMC implementations used in practice, even though this comparison does not involve confidence intervals and might not be entirely fair from a purely theoretical standpoint. This approach is essential for answering our research question and has been largely overlooked in the literature.

Furthermore, most of the literature favors adaptive versions of MLMC that closely follow the original implementation described by \cite{giles2008b}. While effective, these versions are not fully parallelizable due to their inherently sequential design, making them less attractive to practitioners who prioritize scalability and speed. In contrast, our research will focus on more parallelizable methods akin to those introduced in \cite{pageslemaire2015}, which, despite their promise, suffer from certain estimation challenges that we aim to address and optimize for practical use.

Additionally, the current literature tends to concentrate on a limited range of payoff structures, predominantly vanilla European options, lookbacks, barriers, and Asians. To better align our research with industry needs, we will expand the focus to include fixed income products such as trigger accumulator payoffs, forward accumulator payoffs, swaptions, and Bermudan caplets. By addressing these gaps, our study seeks to bridge the divide between academic research and industry practice, offering more relevant and applicable insights into the use of MLMC methods in real-world financial settings.
