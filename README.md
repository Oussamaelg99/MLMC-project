## Introduction

This package implements the MLMC method for scenarios where traditional MC methods are computationally expensive. It is particularly useful in fields such as quantitative finance, risk management, and engineering.

## Features

- **Efficient Simulation**: Reduce computational time significantly without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with computational resources, benefiting from multi-core and distributed systems.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to integrate with other Python libraries and custom workflows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the MLMC package, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib (for computational tasks and visualization)

### Installation Steps

To install the MLMC package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install mlmc-package
```

Alternatively, if you wish to install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlmc-package.git
cd mlmc-package
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

To get started with the MLMC package, here is a simple example that demonstrates its basic functionality:

```python
from mlmc import MLMC, Level

# Define your problem-specific parameters
levels = [Level(0.01, 100), Level(0.005, 200)]

# Create an MLMC instance
mlmc_instance = MLMC(levels)

# Compute the estimate
estimate = mlmc_instance.compute_estimate()
print(f"MLMC Estimate: {estimate}")
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

This example shows how to set up a simple MLMC simulation:

```python
# More detailed example code here
```

### Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, consider the following setup:

```python
# Advanced example involving multiple levels and custom configurations
```
