\begin{frame}{Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC)}

\textbf{Concept}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combines Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods with multilevel frameworks for improved accuracy.
    \item QMC uses low-discrepancy sequences, providing better coverage of the integration domain.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Theoretical Results}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited theoretical foundation: while improved convergence rates are observed, there is a lack of comprehensive error bounds and complexity results.
    \item Significant empirical success, but more work is needed on theoretical analysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Challenges}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item QMCâ€™s efficiency diminishes in high dimensions without techniques like scrambling.
    \item Non-smooth integrands reduce the effectiveness of QMC, requiring careful adjustments.
\end{itemize}
